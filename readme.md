Lists are separated into groups, you can have any number of groups and any number of lists in a group.

## Groups

Groups contain as many lists as you'd like. Think of groups as a category for your lists. There could be a group for shopping lists and each list could be a different store.
There could be a group for issues for your GitHub project, with lists for enhancements, bugs or, documentation.

## Lists

Lists are sortable, all the items in a list can be re-ordered by dragging an item to where you want it to be in the list.

## Items

Each item is made up of the item text (what is shown in the list) and details, which can be seen by clicking the 'eye' button, to elaborate on an item.
